Task two will find the greatest common denominator of two integer inputs: “a” and “b”. 

The program starts with setting all the variables to zero for good practice. Before creating input prompts for “a” and “b”, the prompts will use a while loop to check that the inputs are integers and if they are not it will prompt the user to re-input the variable’s value. An example of the input while loop is shown below and it would be used twice. 

The program checks if the inputs are the same, and if they are outputs “b”, however it could have output “a” with the same result. This is checked by taking the one input from the other, and if the result is zero then it outputs “b”.

Depending on whichever value out of “a”, “b” and “c”, while c is equal to “a” minus “b”, is the greatest common denominator of “a” and “b”. The defined function is named variable “d” and is printed in the last line, which if “a” is 12 and “b” is 4 would read:

The gcd of 12 and 4 is 4.
