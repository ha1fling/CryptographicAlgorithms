The original code within this repository was written in the last taught semester of my bachelors degree in 2017. It was the first code I ever wrote & I hope to re-write it to look back at how far I have come.

The assignment required a write up explanation of what the code does along with LOTS of comments. I hate commenting as much as I did on here but it was necessary for the assignment.

The write ups of what the code is doing can be found in the README.md files within the original code folders.

I got 92% for this assignment as it was being marked on a mathematical basis and not a coding basis. I'm aware it is far from perfect.
