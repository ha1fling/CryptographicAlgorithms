Task three continues from task two. Once the greatest common denominator is found as explained in task 2, a simple if statement is employed to find out if the numbers: “a” and “b” are relative primes. If the greatest common denominator of two numbers is one, then they are relative primes. Since, to get an integer because of a division; relative primes are only divisible by one and themselves. 

The algorithm used, expresses that if the result of the greatest common denominator function was one, then the program would print that they are relative primes. The next statement would be that else, they are not relative primes. For them to be relative primes, the greatest common denominator can only be one, and so any other result would mean they are not relative primes. 

In Python 3.5.2, the following algorithm was added on to the greatest common denominator function:
    
```
if d==1:

print (a, "and", b, "are relative primes")

else:

print (a, "and", b, "are not relative primes.")
```
